# @sanity/locale-pt-pt

Portuguese / PortuguÃªs language support for [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/).

## Description

This is a community maintained language plugin. Initial translations were done by AI and may have errors. Contributions are [more than welcome](#contributing)!

## Installation

```sh
npm install @sanity/locale-pt-pt
```

## Usage

```ts
// sanity.config.ts / sanity.config.js:
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {ptPTLocale} from '@sanity/locale-pt-pt'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins here ...
    ptPTLocale(),
  ],
})
```

The language should now show up in the Studio's user menu.

If you want to customize the title of the locale, pass it as an option to the plugin:

```ts
// sanity.config.ts / sanity.config.js:
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {ptPTLocale} from '@sanity/locale-pt-pt'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins here ...
    ptPTLocale({
      title: 'Portuguese',
    }),
  ],
})
```
